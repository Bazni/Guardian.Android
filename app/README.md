# GuardianSDK sample app

## Running

Before running the sample app please configure your google app id and Guardian url properly.

You should change your google app id (required for GCM push notifications) at `src/main/res/values/google_gcm.xml`.

The Guardian url can be changed at `src/main/res/values/guardian.xml`. It should look like
`https://<YOUR_TENANT>.guardian.auth0.com`.
